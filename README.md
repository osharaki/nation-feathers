## Plot
You are a hungry, aquatic bird :bird: on a mission: to eat as many of the squid :octopus: floating on the 
water :ocean: as you can before you starve.

But be careful! The water level is dropping rapidly, and with it the floating 
squid. Navigate your way through the swampy terrain and avoid bumping into the 
hills. 

Bon Apetit! :fork_and_knife:
